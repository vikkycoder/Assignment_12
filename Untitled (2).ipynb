    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are two broad categories of databases that differ in their data models, storage structures, query languages, and use cases. Below are the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases: SQL databases are relational databases based on the relational model. Data is organized into tables with predefined schemas, and relationships between tables are established using foreign keys. Each table has rows representing records and columns representing attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases: NoSQL databases use various data models, including key-value, document, column-family, and graph. They offer more flexibility in data representation and do not require a fixed schema. NoSQL databases can handle semi-structured or unstructured data more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases: Traditional SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning they can be upgraded by increasing the hardware resources of a single server. This has limitations in terms of the maximum capacity a single server can handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases: NoSQL databases are designed to be horizontally scalable, allowing them to distribute data across multiple servers and handle large amounts of data and traffic more efficiently."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that deals with defining and managing the structure of a database. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects, such as tables, indexes, and views. These commands do not manipulate the actual data within the tables; instead, they focus on defining the structure and properties of the database objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the four main DDL commands and their usage with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE command is used to create new database objects. The most common usage is to create tables. When creating a table, you specify the table's name, columns, data types, constraints, and other properties.\n",
    "Example - Creating a table:\n",
    "Suppose we want to create a table to store information about books in a library. The table could have columns like BookID, Title, Author, and PublishedYear.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`  CREATE TABLE books (\n",
    "   BookID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "   Title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n",
    "   Author VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "   PublishedYear INT\n",
    " ); `\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we created a table called \"books\" with columns \"BookID,\" \"Title,\" \"Author,\" and \"PublishedYear.\" The \"BookID\" column is set as the primary key, and \"Title\" and \"Author\" columns are marked as NOT NULL to ensure they are always populated.\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP:\n",
    "The DROP command is used to remove database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views, from the database. This operation is irreversible and permanently deletes the specified object and all its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Dropping a table:\n",
    "Let's say we want to remove the \"books\" table from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "` DROP TABLE books; `\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing this command, the \"books\" table will be deleted, and all data stored within it will be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or dropping columns, changing data types, or adding constraints.\n",
    "Example - Adding a column:\n",
    "Suppose we want to add a new column to the \"books\" table to store the genre of each book.\n",
    "\n",
    "` ALTER TABLE books\n",
    " ADD Genre VARCHAR(30); `\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we added a new column called \"Genre\" to the existing \"books\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all the data from a table while retaining the table's structure. Unlike the DROP command, TRUNCATE does not delete the table itself; it simply removes all the rows within it.\n",
    "Example - Truncating a table:\n",
    "Let's say we want to remove all the data from the \"books\" table while keeping the table structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "` TRUNCATE TABLE books; `\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing this command, all the rows in the \"books\" table will be removed, but the table structure will remain intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essential to exercise caution when using DDL commands, especially the DROP and TRUNCATE commands, as they can have irreversible consequences. Always make sure to back up critical data before performing such operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "INSERT:\n",
    "The INSERT command is used to add new rows (records) into a database table. It allows you to specify the values to be inserted into each column of the table.\n",
    "Example - Inserting data into a table:\n",
    "Suppose we have a table named \"students\" that stores information about students, including their ID, name, age, and course.\n",
    "\n",

    "  \n",
    "In this example, we used the INSERT command to add a new row to the \"students\" table. The values for each column are specified in the VALUES clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE:\n",
    "The UPDATE command is used to modify existing data in the database table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns for one or multiple rows based on specified conditions.\n",
    "Example - Updating data in a table:\n",
    "Suppose we want to update the course of a student with ID 1 from \"Computer Science\" to \"Electrical Engineering.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "` UPDATE students\n",
    " SET Course = 'Electrical Engineering'\n",
    " WHERE ID = 1; `\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we used the UPDATE command to change the value of the \"Course\" column for the row where the \"ID\" is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE:\n",
    "The DELETE command is used to remove one or more rows (records) from a database table based on specified conditions.\n",
    "Example - Deleting data from a table:\n",
    "Suppose we want to delete the record of a student with ID 2 from the \"students\" table.\n",

    "` DELETE FROM students\n",
    "WHERE ID = 2; `\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we used the DELETE command to remove the row from the \"students\" table where the \"ID\" is equal to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to be cautious when using DML commands, especially the UPDATE and DELETE commands, as they can modify or remove data irreversibly. Always ensure that you have a backup of critical data before performing such operations. Additionally, consider using conditions (WHERE clause) carefully to update or delete specific rows to avoid unintended data changes.\n",
